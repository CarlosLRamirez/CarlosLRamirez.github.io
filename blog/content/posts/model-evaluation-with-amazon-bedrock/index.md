As part of my process 

Task Statement 3.4: Describe methods to evaluate foundation model performance.
Objectives:
• Understand approaches to evaluate foundation model performance (for
example, human evaluation, benchmark datasets).
• Identify relevant metrics to assess foundation model performance (for
example, Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation [ROUGE],
Bilingual Evaluation Understudy [BLEU], BERTScore).
• Determine whether a foundation model effectively meets business
objectives (for example, productivity, user engagement, task engineering)
