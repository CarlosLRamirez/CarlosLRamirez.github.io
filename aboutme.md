I have nearly 15 years of experience as an IT professional, I started my career as a cellular network engineer at Ericsson before transitioning to the realm of enterprise networks and IT infrastructure. Throughout my career, I have developed extensive expertise in managing, designing, implementing, and supporting IT infrastructure for small businesses and large organizations across the country. In recent years, my focus has shifted towards IT project management, with a particular emphasis on cloud computing, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Looking ahead, I am passionate about providing agility to enterprises in their digital transformation process. This includes leveraging cloud computing and DevOps practices to help organizations streamline their IT operations and accelerate innovation. I am excited to continue growing my career in this direction and making a meaningful impact in the field of information technology.∫∫
